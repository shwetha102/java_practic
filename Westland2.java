One such game was called the "Triangle game", where different number boards in the range 1 to 180 are available. Each kid needs to select three number boards, where the numbers on the boards correspond to the angles of a triangle.If the angles selected by a kid forms a triangle, he/she would receive Prize 1. If the angles selected by a kid forms a right triangle, he/she would receive Prize 2.If the angles selected by the kids form an equilateral triangle,he/she would receive Prize 3. If the angles selected by a kid do not form even a triangle, 
then he/she will not receive any prizes. Write a program for the organizers to fetch the result based on the number boards selected by the kids.
